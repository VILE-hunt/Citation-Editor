# About Vile Citation Editor, THIS IS NOT PROFESSIONAL. DO NOT EXPECT IT TO BE.
Vile Citation Editor is an in-development citation tool designed to be like a basic text editor while also having citations such as debate cards, chicago style, and legal citations
Currently, you can only cite in Chicago style.
You must click enter for every textbox. Then click cite. If you are writing something else as well, click save so it does not get erased when a new citation is generated.  **Even if there is not a certain part, such as a name, click enter.**
